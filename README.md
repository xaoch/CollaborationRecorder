# CollaborationRecorder
A device to record and analyze collaboration.

This repository contains the instructions and code to build a collaboration recorder.  The hardware and software are in continous evolution and this should be consider an experimental device at this moment.

## Hardware
To build the Collaboration Recorder you will need:

* A [Raspberry Pi 3 or 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (Processing unit)
* A [Respeaker circular 6-mic for Raspberry Pi](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-6-Mic-Circular-Array-Kit-for-Raspberry-Pi.html) (For recording directional audio)
* A [Fisheye camera for Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.com/Dorhea-Raspberry-Camera-Fisheye-Megapixel/dp/B07JPXBF3X/ref=sr_1_13?crid=2HZ31N14YXYXJ&dchild=1&keywords=fisheye+raspberry+pi&qid=1623686859&sprefix=fisheye+raspberr%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-13) (For recording video around the device 
* (Optional) A [Battery pack for Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Raspberry-Recharging-Function-Expansion/dp/B08HLXGS3W/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=battery%2Bpack%2Braspberry%2Bpi&qid=1623686961&sr=8-4&th=1) (For unthethered operation)
* (Optional) Two [18650 Batteries](https://www.amazon.com/Flashlight-Rechargeable-Zoomable-Resistant-Handheld/dp/B08JLVBGVW/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&keywords=18650+batteries&qid=1623687454&s=hi&sr=1-7) (For unthethered operation)
